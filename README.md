# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

Objective

Using Angular, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on
its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting
documentation.

Context

As the modern workplace continues to transform, remote work has become more important than
ever. Whether you end up working in an office or from home, it's crucial that you know how to
communicate and collaborate effectively.
In this Achievement, you'll learn how to work with others by writing and sharing documentation with
your peers, providing feedback, and making a contribution to the tech community. The ability to create
detailed and straightforward handoffs for other developers is an indispensable skill that you'll need
when applying for a job.
Opportunities to engage with these skills will be provided by your Achievement 6 project. For your
project, you'll return to the myFlix app's server-side from Achievement 2 and build the client-side
interface for a new single-page, responsive app, one that includes several interface views that will
handle data through the previously-defined REST API endpoints.
This time you'll use Angular, instead of React. Angular is an extremely popular framework that can be
used for a wide range of mobile and desktop applications. It's particularly well-suited to large projects,
as well as projects requiring a complex user interface because it comes with a variety of built-in
modules and services.
As you work on this project, youâ€™ll use Agile project management techniques including user stories,
story points, and a kanban board. These techniques are commonly used by companies in the tech
industry. At the same time, you'll practice communicating the skills and knowledge that you're
acquiring with technical interview questions, before adding the project to, and finalizing, your online
portfolio
